An Android library introducing a stack of Views with the first item being flippable.

`Views` inside the stack remain the aspect ratio of the `FlippableStackView`.

Usage
=====
*For a working implementation of this library see the `sample/` folder.*

  1. Include the view inside your layout xml
  
      ```xml
      <com.bartoszlipinski.flippablestackview.FlippableStackView
        android:id="@+id/stack"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" />
      ```

  2. `FlippableStackView` is based on the specific `PageTransformer` used with the `ViewPager`. Therefore to fill the `View` you can use just a typical implementation of a [`PagerAdapter`][1]. In your `onCreate` method (or `onCreateView` for a fragment), setup all the parameters of the `FlippableStackView`.

      ```java
      FlippableStackView stack = (FlippableStackView) findViewById(R.id.stack);
      stack.initStack(2);
      stack.setAdapter(mStackAdapter); //assuming mStackAdapter contains your initialized adapter
      ```
      
**Important Note:**
The current implementation of the library will display the elements from the `Adapter` in the reverse order. In other words: view at position 0 of your adapter will be displayed at the bottom of the stack and view at position `adapter.getCount()-1` will be visible first (available for the first flip).

Customization
-------------
The `FlippableStackView` is highly customizable to provide you with just the visual effect you really wanted.

There are three methods that allows for initialization of the stack:

  1. First one sets up the stack in the default way (scale-wise and orientation-wise):
 
       ```java
       public void initStack(int numberOfStacked)
       ```

  2. The second one sets up the stack in the default way (scale-wise) but let's you choose the orientation of it:

      ```java
      public void initStack(int numberOfStacked, StackPageTransformer.Orientation orientation)
      ```

  2. And the last one... a bit more advanced (lets you customize all the scale-related, orientation-related and alignment-related parameters):
  
        ```java
        public void initStack(int numberOfStacked,
                              StackPageTransformer.Orientation orientation,
                              float currentPageScale,
                              float topStackedScale,
                              float overlapFactor,
                              StackPageTransformer.Gravity gravity)
        ```
 
 Be sure to read about all the parameters in `Javadoc` before using the last one.

Including In Your Project
-------------------------
You can grab the library via Maven Central. Just add a proper dependency inside your `build.gradle`. Like this:

```xml
dependencies {
    compile 'com.hkm.ui:flippable-stack-view:1.3.1'
}
```
